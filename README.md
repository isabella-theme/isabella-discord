# Isabella for Discord

This is custom css for Discord. It makes the interface more compact when in compact mode, and makes Discord use the [Isabella color scheme.](https://github.com/isabella-theme) It's not done but should be usable.

You can use [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) to use this css in the browser version of Discord, or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) to use it in the desktop version. Although beware that injecting custom css into the native Discord client is technically against Discord's Terms of Service. So use it at your own risk.

Known issues:

- early development, a lot of stuff is broken
- all elements are renamed when Discord updates, so Isabella theme updates are slow
