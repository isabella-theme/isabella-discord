# Isabella for Discord

This is custom css for Discord. It makes the interface more compact when in compact mode, and makes Discord use the [Isabella color scheme.](https://github.com/isabella-theme) It's not done but should be usable.

You can use [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) to use this css in the browser version of Discord, or [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) to use it in the desktop version.
